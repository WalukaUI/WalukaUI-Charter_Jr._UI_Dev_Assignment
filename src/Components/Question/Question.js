        Jr UI Developer Assignment A retailer offers a rewards program to its
        customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. A customer
        receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction,
        plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each
        transaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
        <br />
        Given a record of every transaction during a three month period,
        calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and
        total.
